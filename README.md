# Burn File

We are organising [SEI16](http://seium.org). Everything was going smoothly... until it wasn't.

This repository is where we are keeping track of things that we didn't think were even possible to go wrong, but somehow did.

*NOTE: All checked items on the list did, in fact, happen and we cried at times.*

- [x] facility outage because of extra-holiday that was approved the day before the event
- [x] mentor/coach shortage
- [x] university internet outage
- [x] coffee/beer outage
- [x] facility access mix up leading to us getting blocked from entering the building in front of participants
- [ ] raining all week *(current streak: 5 days out of 7 possible)*
- [x] arcade machines causing a short circuit
- [x] water leak in the event building
- [x] locked out of Heroku and no one knows why
- [x] sleep deprived president tries to make coffee and ends up shocking himself
- [x] car battery broke down
- [x] minor car accident
- [x] shipping company said they would definitely deliver a package on tuesday. Turns out they forgot they didn't work tuesday since it's Mardi Gras. We were informed about this on Wednesday.
