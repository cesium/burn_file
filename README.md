# Burn File

We are organising [SEI16](http://seium.org). Everything was going smoothly... until it wasn't. This is how we are keeping track of things that we didn't think they were possible to go wrong, but somehow did.

*NOTE: All checked items on the list did, in fact, happen and we cried.*

- [x] facility outage because of extra-holiday that was approved the day before the event
- [x] mentor shortage
- [x] university internet outage
- [ ] coffee/beer outage
- [x] facility access mix up leading to us getting blocked from entering the building in front of participants
- [ ] raining all week (current streak: 2 days out of 7 possible)
- [ ] someone fell down a pit
- [ ] polar bear attack
